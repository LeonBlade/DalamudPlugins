From here, you can now install my plugins from within the game by typing `/xlplugins` in the chat and hitting enter.
Now, just select one of my plugins you wish to install like normal, and click "Install".
All of my plugins are tagged with my username "LeonBlade", so you can enter that in the search field to see all of the plugins I've created.
